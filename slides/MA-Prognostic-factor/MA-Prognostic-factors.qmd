### Prognostic factors

**What are prognostic factors?**

Any information that, among people with a given health condition, is associated with a subsequent health outcome

Example

-   Information:
    -   tumour grade
-   Health condition:
    -   patients diagnosed with cancer
-   Health outcome(s):
    -   subsequent disease
    -   recurrence of death

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common examples

Routinely collected patient characteristics

-   Sex
-   Age
-   body mass index
-   smoking status
-   blood pressure
-   co-morbidities
-   symptoms

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Use of prognostic factors

1.  Aiding treatment decisions
2.  Improving individual risk prediction
3.  Providing novel targets for new treatment
4.  Enhancing the design and analysis of randomised trials

![Reff: Altman. Systematic reviews of evaluations of prognostic variables. BMJ 2001](images/Picture2.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Need for evidence synthesis

It is important to identify genuine prognostic factors.

However:

-   There is often conflicting evidence about the prognostic value of certain variables
-   The quality of many prognostic studies is poor

This motivates the need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses that summarise the (adjusted) prognostic effect of each factor of interest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data extraction

**Data extraction**

Key elements to extract for each factor of interest

-   Estimates of the (adjusted) prognostic effect
    -   risk ratio or odds ratio (for binary outcomes)
    -   hazard ratio (for time-to-event outcome)
    -   mean difference (for continuous outcomes such as pain or depression score)
-   Corresponding standard errors or confidence intervals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data extraction

When not reported, unadjusted hazard ratios (and their variances) can be estimated:

-   Using the number of outcomes (events) and an available p-value (e.g. from a log-rank test or Cox regression)

![](images/Picture3.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data extraction

When not reported, unadjusted hazard ratios (and their variances) can be estimated:

-   from survival proportions

![](images/Picture4.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### An example

A systematic review was performed

-   to evaluate the quality of prognostic research evidence
-   for the association of C-reactive protein (CRP)
-   with fatal and nonfatal events
-   among patients with stable coronary disease

**Ref**: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000286

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### An example

Data extraction

-   "We extracted the reported relative risk, odds ratio or hazard ratio, and 95% CIs from each study."
-   "We extracted the relative risks with the largest number of adjustment variables"
-   "We converted the reported relative risk estimates onto a standard scale of effect, comparing the highest third with the lowest third of the CRP distribution"

**Ref**: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000286

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Meta-Analysis

**Meta-Analysis**

Summarize multiple estimates of a certain factor-outcome association (e.g. log hazard ratios)\
2 options:

-   Fixed effect meta-analysis
-   Random effects meta-analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fixed effect meta-analysis

It is assumed that all studies share the same factor-outcome association

![](images/Picture5.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fixed effect meta-analysis

It is assumed that all studies share the same factor-outcome association. *The only source of variation is estimation error* ($ùúÄ$) due to limited sample size.

![](images/Picture6.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fixed effect meta-analysis

The pooled estimate is an average of all factor-outcome associations, weighted by their precision:

$\hat{\theta}_k \sim$ N $(D_F,$ $V(\hat{\delta_k}))$

where

-   $\hat{\theta}_k$ represents the estimated factor-outcome association (e.g. log hazard ratio) of study *k*,
-   $V(\hat{\delta_k})$ is the error variance
-   $D_F$ is the fixed effect meta-analysis summary (e.g. pooled log hazard ratio)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Arguments against fixed effect MA

It is often unrealistic to assume that all studies estimate the same prognostic effect

![](images/Picture7.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Random effects meta-analysis

-   Unexplained heterogeneity is likely to exist due to:
    -   Publication bias
    -   Variation in study design & quality
    -   Variation in inclusion criteria
    -   Differences in treatments received during follow-up
    -   Different types of prognostic effect measures (e.g. odds ratio and hazard ratios)
    -   Different sets of adjustment factors
    -   ...
-   A random effects meta-analysis approach is essential to allow for unexplained heterogeneity across studies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Random effects meta-analysis

Heterogeneity may, for instance, appear when reviewing a continuous prognostic factor, as individual studies...

-   may consider non-linear trends
-   may consider a linear trend
-   may examine a trend across multiple categories of prognostic factor values.
-   may apply a cut-point (threshold) to dichotomise the continuous factor into two groups. The choice of cut-point often varies across studies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Random effects meta-analysis

Each study has a distinct prognostic effect, but there is a distribution of true effects. We are interested in estimating the mean (and variance) of this distribution

![](images/Picture8.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Random effects meta-analysis

The meta-analysis now accounts for 2 sources of variation:

1.  Estimation error within studies ($ùúÄ$)
2.  True variation in effect sizes between studies ($Œ∂$)

![](images/Picture9.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Random effects meta-analysis

We now have:

$\hat{\theta}_k \sim N (D_F, V(\hat{\delta_k}))$

$\hat{\delta_k} \sim N(D_R, \tau^2)$

With

-   $V({\theta}_k)$ the within-study error variance
-   $\tau^2$ the between-study variance
-   $D_R$ is the random effect meta-analysis summary (e.g. pooled log hazard ratio)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Avoiding heterogeneity

Meta-analysis results of prognostic factor studies will be most interpretable and thus useful when considering:

-   Hazard ratios, odds ratios and risk ratios separately
-   Unadjusted and adjusted associations separately
-   Prognostic factor effects at distinct cut-points (or groups of similar cut-points) separately
-   Prognostic factor effects corresponding to a linear trend (association) separately
-   Prognostic factor effects corresponding to non-linear trends separately
-   Each method of measurement (for factors and outcomes) separately

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CRP example

Forest plot showing the study-specific estimates and meta-analysis summary result of the adjusted prognostic effect (risk ratio) of CRP. All studies were minimally adjusted for age, gender, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and lipids.

![](images/Picture10.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CRP example

The summary meta-analysis result was a risk ratio of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.34 to 2.04)

-   which gives the average prognostic effect of CRP (for those in the top versus bottom third of CRP distribution)
-   which suggests larger CRP values are associated with higher risk.

**Ref**: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000286

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Use of appropriate meta-analysis methods

When calculating confidence intervals

-   Adjust the standard error of the summary estimate using the method proposed by Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman
-   Use a Student T distribution (instead of a Normal distribution)

**Ref**: IntHout et al. The Hartung-Knapp Sidik-Jonkman method for random effects meta-analysis is striaightforward and considerably outperforms the standard DerSimonian-Laird method. BMC Med Res Meth 2014

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CRP example

The summary meta-analysis result was a risk ratio of

-   Without Hartung-Knapp correction

    1.65 (95% CI: 1.39 to 1.96)

-   With Hartung-Knapp correction

    1.65 (95% CI: 1.34 to 2.04)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Advanced meta-analysis methods

-   Dose-response models
    -   to summarize the effect size as a function of exposure level
-   Multivariate meta-analysis methods, to jointly handle
    -   multiple cut-points
    -   multiple methods of measurement
    -   different adjustment factors in prognostic factor studies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Investigating heterogeneity

**Recommendations**

If heterogeneity is present

-   The random-effects estimate should be interpreted differently from the fixed effect estimate
-   Focusing on the mean is insufficient, and the effect of heterogeneity should be quantified (e.g. prediction intervals)
-   Explore possible causes of heterogeneity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Prediction interval

We can derive an approximate 95% prediction interval, which provides a range for the true prognostic effect in a new study population:

$\hat{D_R} \pm$ $t_{K-2}$ $\sqrt{{\hat{\tau}^2} + var(\hat{D_R})}$

$t_{K-2}$ is the $100(1‚àíùõº‚ÅÑ2)$ percentile of the t distribution with *K--2* degrees of freedom, where *K* is the number of studies in the meta-analysis and is usually chosen as 0.05, to give a 5% significance level and thus 95% prediction interval.

Note that the prediction interval can be calculated more accurately within a Bayesian framework (as it allows for estimation error of $\hat{\tau}^2$)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CRP Example

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Meta-regression

Adjust the meta-analysis for study-level variables

-   Study characteristics
    -   *Study design*
    -   *Follow-up time*
    -   *Predictor- and outcome definitions*
-   Population characteristics
    -   *Mean of individual covariates*
    -   *SD of individual covariates*
    -   *Treatment standards*

Such that the summary estimate becomes defined by one (or more) study-level covariates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Meta-regression

Limitations

-   There will often be few studies per subgroup and low power to detect genuine causes of heterogeneity
-   Danger of study-level confounding, such that it is difficult to disentangle the associations for one covariate from another (**ecological bias**)

For example, studies with a low risk of bias may also have a different length of follow-up, or a particular cut-point level, compared with studies at higher risk of bias.
