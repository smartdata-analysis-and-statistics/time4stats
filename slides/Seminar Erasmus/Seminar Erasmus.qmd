## Need for evidence synthesis

Single studies often have limited power, especially when

- Estimating treatment-covariate interactions
- Modelling of multiple treatments
- Developing & validating prediction models

IPD meta-analysis offers particular advantages when focusing on personalized medicine

## Need for evidence synthesis

**Main opportunities**

- Increase total sample size
- Increase available case-mix variability
- Ability to standardize analysis methods across IPD sets
- Ability to investigate more complex associations
- Ability to evaluate generalizability of the model across different settings and populations

## Approaches for IPD-MA

Two alternate approaches exist to summarize the evidence from multiple studies:

- **Two-stage meta-analysis**
  
  Analyze each study separately and pool the resulting estimates using standard meta-analytic techniques

- **One-stage meta-analysis**
  
  Analyze IPD from all studies simultaneously by adopting a statistical model that accounts for clustering among patients

![](Picture 1.png){width=20% fig-align="right"}


## Two-stage meta-analysis

**Step 1**: Analyze each trial individually to reduce the IPD to relevant summary data (aggregate data; AD)

- Estimates of relative treatment effect
- Estimates of treatment-covariate interaction
- Other…

with corresponding estimates of precision

**Step 2**: Summarize the generated AD using meta-analysis methods

## One-stage meta-analysis

Analyze all studies simultaneously by specifying an appropriate statistical model that accounts for clustering of subjects within trials.

When accounting for clustering, these models are also known as:

- Multilevel models
- Hierarchical models
- Mixed effects models
- Random intercept models

## Assumptions of meta-analysis models

- **Fixed (common) effect**
  
  All studies share the same underlying (e.g. treatment) effect
  
  \
- **Random effects**
  
  Effects are different but related across studies

  \
- **Stratified (fixed) effects**
  
  Effects are different and unrelated across studies
  
## Possible causes of between-study heterogeneity

- Publication bias
- Variation in study protocols
- Variation in study quality
- Differences in interventions received (e.g. dose)
- Differences in follow-up length
- Treatment-covariate interaction

## Treatment-covariate interaction

The magnitude of treatment effect (measured on a scale such as a mean difference, risk ratio, odds ratio, or hazard ratio) changes according to the value of a risk factor

\

This situation is also referred to as presence of **subgroup effects**

\

Estimation of treatment-covariate interaction is highly prone to overfitting

## Treatment-covariate interaction

## Identifying subgroup effects in IPDMA

- Increased power to detect genuine treatment-covariate interactions, due to

    - Increased sample size
    - Increased variability in case-mix

- Potential to avoid ecological bias (as compared to AD-MA)by separating within-trial from across-trial information 
- Potential to invesstigate non-linear effects

## Identifying subgroup effects in IPDMA

**Practical example**

- 5 RCTs for bilateral Acute Otitis Media
- Efficacy of antibiotics on fever and/or ear-pain after 3-7 days
- Investigation of treatment effect modification by age

    - Restricted cubic splines (3 knots)
    - B splines (3 equidistant knots)
    - P splines (17 equidistant knots)
    - Smoothing splines

- Pooling methods

    - Pointwise meta-analysis of treatment effect function
    - Multivariate meta-analysis of treatment effect parameters
    - Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM)

## Pointwise (two-stage) meta-analysis

## Multivariate (two-stage) meta-analysis

![](Picture 4.png)


## GAMMs (one-stage meta-analysis)

![](Picture 5.png)


## Identifying subgroup effects in IPDMA

All spline-based approaches and pooling methods performed equally well. However,

- Pointwise meta-analysis may lead to non-smooth pooled treatment functions and confidence intervals. 
GAMMs are prone to ecological bias
- Multivariate meta-analysis requires well defined parameters to pool but can yield smooth treatment functions and avoids ecological bias

Estimation of treatment effect functions helps to investigate presence and nature of effect modification

## Individualizing treatment effect estimates

Estimates of relative risk and subgroup effects

- Do not indicate how individual outcomes are affected by treatment 
- Cannot directly be used to personalize healthcare

What outcomes are most likely to happen for the specific individual <span style="color:blue;">in the presence</span> and <span style="color:blue;">in the absence</span> of the intervention?

=> Prediction of counterfactual treatment outcomes

## Prediction of absolute treatment effect

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em"}
Develop a multivariable (e.g. regression) model directly on RCT data with inclusion of

<span style="color:blue;">Prognostic variables</span>

- Subject characteristics (e.g. age, gender)
- History and physical examination results (e.g. blood pressure)
- Imaging results
- (Bio)markers (e.g. coronary plaque)

## Estimation of absolute treatment effect

- Accurate estimates of <span style="color:blue;">relative treatment effect</span> remain key

    - An obvious choice to develop treatment effect models is to use patient-level data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs)

- Accurate estimates of <span style="color:blue;">prognostic effects</span> are important

    - Prognostic effects can reliably be estimated in randomized data but also in non-randomized studies

- Accurate estimates of <span style="color:blue;">baseline risk</span> are important

    - Due to strict eligibility criteria, RCT-based estimates of baseline risk may not generalize well to real-world populations

## A selection of modeling approaches

- Risk magnification

    - Prediction model where treatment status is included as a main effect
    - #parameters: p (<span style="color:blue;">predictors</span>) + 1 (<span style="color:blue;">treatment</span>) + 1 (<span style="color:blue;">intercept</span>)

- Full modelling

    - Prediction model with one or more treatment-covariate interactions
    - #parameters: p (<span style="color:blue;">predictors</span>) + 1 (<span style="color:blue;">treatment</span>) + 1 (<span style="color:blue;">intercept</span>) + q (<span style="color:blue;">interactions</span>)

- Baseline risk modification

    - Prediction model that includes an interaction between treatment and the linear predictor 
    - #parameters: p (<span style="color:blue;">predictors</span>) + 1 (<span style="color:blue;">treatment</span>) + 1 (<span style="color:blue;">intercept</span>) + 1 (<span style="color:blue;">interaction</span>)

## Findings from simulation studies

- Risk magnification generally works well 
- Shrinkage and selection critical even in large RCTs
- Inclusion of interaction terms should be driven by domain knowledge
- Modelling of interaction terms only beneficial in large trials

Danger of overfitting & lack of sample representativeness
=> IPDMA may help to improve internal & external validity

## Personalizing treatment in major depression

**Practical example**

- Multi-centre trial to examine treatment strategies for untreated unipolar major depressive episodes (N = 1544) => **similarities with IPDMA**
- Prediction of PHQ-9 (depression severity, ranges from 0 to 27) after 9 weeks
- Identify treatment benefit of

    - Continuing sertraline (N = 512)
    - Continuing sertraline and adding mirtazapine (N = 502)
    - Switching to mirtazapine (N  = 530)

- 88 covariates

    - Socio-demographic variables
    - Baseline clinical characteristics
    - Depression characteristics

**Modelling strategies**

- Penalized linear regression (LASSO)
- Penalized linear regression (ridge)
- Support Vector Machine (polynomial or radial kernel)
- Artificial neural network (1 hidden layer and 3 or 4 nodes)

Repeated 10-fold cross-validation for optimization of hyper-parameters

Generate a prediction of the outcome under all three different treatment strategies (potential outcomes)

## Personalizing treatment in major depression

**Three subgroup of patients**

- Recommended to continue sertraline (123 patients)
- Recommended to combine mirtazapine and sertraline (696 patients)
- Recommended to switch to mirtazapine (725 patients)

Both combining and switching would reduce PHQ-9 scores by 1.2 to 1.4 points in the targeted population
